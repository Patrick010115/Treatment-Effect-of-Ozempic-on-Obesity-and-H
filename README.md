# Ozempic's Therapeutic Outcomes on Obesity and Hypertension

## Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of Ozempic’s market impact and therapeutic effectiveness in treating obesity and hypertension. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with robust predictive modeling, this project uncovers key factors that influence patient recovery and highlights disparities in insurance reimbursements across different states and demographics.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Analytics**: Utilizes Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling techniques such as Double Random Forest, Double Lasso, Logistic Regression, and Causal Analysis.
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Conducts extensive exploratory data analysis to reveal actionable insights into patient demographics and treatment patterns.
- **Healthcare Valuation**: Employs the SMART_ALLOWED metric—an AI-driven proxy for payer payment amounts—to assess healthcare value.
- **Strategic Insights**: Identifies opportunities for targeted business strategies and equitable healthcare policies.

## Background
Obesity and hypertension remain major challenges in the healthcare sector, especially in diabetes management. Ozempic, developed by Novo Nordisk, is not only FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes but also plays a significant role in weight loss. Its dual impact on blood sugar and weight management sets it apart in a competitive market, providing a unique edge in both clinical and business realms.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection & Sources**:
  - **Medical Claims**: [Access Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0dwkliBw5b0Qe-K4blUQJtIMRI_ViTi/view?usp=sharing)
  - **Prescriptions**: [Access Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8-uC4P5w3vI-zV5_LV0EOnHQX22XWut/view?usp=drive_link)
  - **Heart_2020**: Data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute focusing on factors like obesity, lifestyle, and smoking.
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Dropped duplicates and addressed missing values.
  - Selected essential columns and engineered an age group variable to enhance analysis and enable effective dataset merging.
  - Refined the heart_2020 dataset to focus on health-related features like BMI and sleep time.
  - Concentrated analysis on patients aged 40 to 75 with key conditions such as hypertension (I10) and obesity (E66).

## Implications & Future Work
- **Targeted Business Strategies**: Uncovering disparities in insurance reimbursements opens doors for state-specific and demographic-specific approaches.
- **Policy Advocacy**: The insights could empower Novo Nordisk to advocate for more equitable healthcare policies.
- **Patient Support Programs**: Data-driven insights pave the way for the development of tailored patient support initiatives.

## Conclusion
This project reinforces the power of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. By linking clinical effectiveness with economic and policy impacts, it demonstrates how robust analytics can foster innovation in pharmaceutical care and drive better patient outcomes.
